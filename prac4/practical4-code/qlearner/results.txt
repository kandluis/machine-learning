At iteration 130, the changed the above so that the state space became larger.

Below are the results from 130 to 156.

Optimizing function was the same as above.

Now, I am further relaxing the constraints on the velocity so that it can be up to 1000.


Lastly, we are changing the constraints (restarting, actually), so that now we run 3000 iterations of training and measure over the following 500 iterations of testing. 

This will hopefully allow us to achieve much higher results.
